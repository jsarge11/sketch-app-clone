# Project Completed by @jsarge11, @SkySor44, @spencermrobinson, @xanadew

Cloned the Desktop App, Sketch, onto the web - allowing users to manipulate elements to create basic wireframes and mock-ups.
React, HTML, and CSS (heavy DOM manipulation) are solely used to allow the resizing, recoloring, and other property manipulation tools.
Redux used heavily to manage components of each user, project, sketchpad, shape, etc.
